Here you can find my learning projects which i made for the CS50WEB course.
Each project was made via django, it has it's own databases and frontend. 

1. commerce-website is an e-bay like service where users can make bids.
2. mail allows users to send and receive messages.
3. network-website gives users opportunity to post, like and follow.
